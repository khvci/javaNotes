# javaNotes
 
When switching between different programming languages, it makes easier to take a look on syntax notes, especially if you are new to programming. 

Feel free to copy, edit, use if you find this helpful.

You can find the notes in src folder, or by just clicking <a href="https://github.com/khvci/javaNotes/blob/main/src/Main.java" target="_blank">here</a>.
